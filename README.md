Shopping cart tax calculation system

###Using the template method design pattern to avoid duplication of classes and tax###

+ Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to client subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

+ Base class declares algorithm 'placeholders', and derived classes implement the placeholders.
